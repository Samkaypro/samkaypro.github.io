It seems like you want to extract the HTML structure created by this JavaScript code. Here is an HTML structure that the code constructs:

```html
<div id="containerD">
    <div id="imageSection">
        <img id="imgDetails" src="[ob.preview]">
    </div>
    <div id="productDetails">
        <h1>[ob.name]</h1>
        <h4>[ob.brand]</h4>
        <div id="details">
            <h3>Rs [ob.price]</h3>
            <h3>Description</h3>
            <p>[ob.description]</p>
        </div>
        <div id="productPreview">
            <h3>Product Preview</h3>
            <img id="previewImg" src="[ob.photos[0]...]" onclick="...">
            <!-- Repeat for other images in ob.photos -->
        </div>
        <div id="button">
            <button>Add to Cart</button>
        </div>
    </div>
</div>
```

Please note that this HTML structure includes placeholders such as `[ob.preview]`, `[ob.name]`, and `[ob.photos[0]...]` where JavaScript variables and data would be inserted. The actual content would depend on the data fetched and processed by the JavaScript code, which isn't available in the provided code snippet.
Here is the HTML structure extracted from your provided JavaScript code:

```html
<div id="cartContainer">
    <div id="boxContainer">
        <!-- Dynamic Cart Items Go Here -->
    </div>
    <div id="totalContainer">
        <div id="total">
            <h2>Total Amount</h2>
            <h4 id="toth4">Amount: Rs [amount]</h4>
            <div id="button">
                <button>
                    <a href="/orderPlaced.html?">Place Order</a>
                </button>
            </div>
        </div>
    </div>
</div>
```

Please note that the dynamic content, such as the items in the cart and the `amount` value, depends on the data fetched and processed by the JavaScript code, which is not available in the provided code snippet. You will need to run the JavaScript code and retrieve the actual content based on the data returned by your API.
